# Drink-Outside-The-Box
An application that allows the user to select a random drink recipe as well as a random joke and save them to tell a friend!

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive application using two server-side APIs, a CSS framework other than bootstrap,  and local storage. This involved working collaboratively to implement [Official_Joke_Api](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) and [The_Cocktail_DB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) on a webpage styled using Bulma that updates dynamically. The implementation included giving users the ability to generate and save their favorite jokes and drinks to local storage.
